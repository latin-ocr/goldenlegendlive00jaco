she should eat somewhat. Then as she stood tofore
her with a candle burning, S. Clare came again to
her estate, and her seemed she was come from an-
other world. And she said: ‘Fair daughter, what
need is of a candle, is it not yet day?’ And she
answered: ‘Right, dear fair mother, the night is
passed and the day is gone, and that other night
is come.' ‘Fair daughter,' said S. Clare, ‘this sleep
that I have made be blessed, for I have much de-
sired it, and God ⁵hath given to me 3 but beware that
thou say it never to creature as long as I live.'

When our Lord knew and apperceived how well

’ and how much this holy Clare loved him, and the

right great love that, she had to the very cross for
the love of him, he so illumined and privileged her
in such manner that she had power to make tokens
and miracles by the cross. For when she made the
sign of the very cross upon them that were sick,
anon the malady fied away. And so many miracles
God showed for her of which 1 shall tell you some.
First, ofa friar that was out of his wit. On a time
it happed S. Francis sent to S. Clare a friar named
Steven‚ and was all mad from himself, that she
should make upon him the sign of the crOSS. For
he knew well that she was a woman of great per-
fection, and he honoured her much for the virtue
that was in her. And she, that was obeissant and
good daughter of obedience‚ blessed the friar by the
commandment of S. FranciS, and made him to sleep
a little, and after, she took him by the hand and he
arose all whole, and went to S. Francis clean delivered

of all his malady.
