14 Bz'ographz’cal Introduction

alive, but ill-responsive to the questionings of our
modern souIS‚ it may well be that only a measure
of closer and more sympathetic study is required to
show us the real kinship which exists-to reveal in
these rnen and women a genuine and noble life—a
life flowing from unfailing sourceS, from some of
which, perhapS‚ we may realize that we have been
too far and too long severed.

In editing this book considerable debts have been
incurred to the already mentioned works of M. de
Wyzewa and Mr Ellis, and to various volumes of the ’

⁴ Bollandist Acta Sanctorum.

My object has been to prepare a volume for popular
though not unscholarly reading ; I have been at pains
to secure the correctness of my text by study of the
oldest printed versions of De Voragine and Caxton ;
but Ι have not sought to meet the requirements osa
literary antiquary. Ι have therefore slightly modern-
ized the spelling. ln the lives selected, which repre-
sent about a tenth of Caxton's entire work, Ι have
made omissions—but sparingly, and in such a way as
not to injure the essential character and atmosphere
of the text. Still more sparingly and slightly have I
ventured on alterations, They were prompted by the
desire of bringing clearness out of confused or corrupt
texts or of Setting right mistranslations ; they occur
chiefly in the lives of S. Austin and S. LouiS.
