Derg‚ amid wild and lonely surrounding-part of the
Irish county of Fermanagh. It has been cele-

strange indeterminateness of these ocean-lands.
The narrator seldom knows, and he does not greatly
care, whether they are material or spiritual realities,
crude facts or significant phantasmagoria. How
sar remote are the atmosphere and tone of this old

countenances‚ and that so fair a title-page tells of a mind
within devoid of divine grace ! ’¹ Again he asked what was
the name of their nation. He was told “they are called
Angli.'' “It is well‚'' he replied, “for they have faces os
