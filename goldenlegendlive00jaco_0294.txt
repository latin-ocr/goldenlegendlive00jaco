PAGE another 1113 by one Robert 01 Salisbury. The

story 01 Winifred is told in just the same way in the
Acta 01 S. Beuno (see next note), which are independ-
ent and of great antiquity. She is not mentioned
by De Voragine. A nineteenth-century historian
01 1113 diocese 01 S. Asaph tries (hardly with success)
to make out that the story is a fountain and river
myth.

Guenevra is a more Celtic 101111 01 1131 name. The
well which perpetuates her memory is called in
Welsh nynnon Gwenffrewi.

139. 1. S. Beuno, notable as a preacher 01 1113 Gospel, was
born in the seventh century of a Welsh 1311131· and a

Scotch mother at Banhenic‚ in Powis‚ on the Severn.
His name is commonly pronounced (not quite cor·

rectly) to rhyme with “rhino.'' He ended his life

at the Abbey of Clynnog-vawr‚ in Carnarvonshire,
which was the chief 01 1113 monastic foundations.
23. “ Cradok,'' or (33130100, Latinized as Caractacus.

143. 4. The story 01 1113 sending 01 1113 chasuble is told better
and at greater length in the original Latin. It is
there said that a gift 01 1113 331113 kind (a chasuble 13
311 upper vestment worn in saying Mass) was sent
in this way by Winifred to Beuno every year on the
first 01 May.

S. Brigid 01 Κ11(1313 is related to have used with
success this same simple method 01 1131131111331011
by stream and sea.

10. Wytheriacus : Gwitherin in Powis.
13. “ Elerius ’' ε 111 Welsh Elwy, 31131· whom (it is said) the
river Elwy in N. Wales is called.

As in the time 01 Elerius‚ so in Caxton's and in
ours there remains to be seen the “ 1311 well giving
out abundantly 1311· 01331 water, where our Lord
God yet daily sheweth many miracles.” It is one
01 1113 finest springs in the world as regards the
extraordinary volume 01 water which it gives out.
It possesses no special medicinal properties. N ever-
theless the cures 01 various kinds that have been
reported as wrought 101 themselves by the numerous
pilgrims who, in a spirit 01 confidence in God and in
the intercession 01 1113 §air-tt, drink the water or
bathe in it, have long been a matter 01 general
notoriet .

We 1131731 hear 01 1113 celebrity 01 1113 holy well
about the year 1100, when the Countess Adeliza and
her son, Earl 01 Chester‚ came to pay their devotions
and offer gifts. In 1420 Pope Martin V. gave in-
dulgenees to the pilgrims. There is a well-authenti-
cated cure 01 1113 year 1667, quoted by the Bollandists
