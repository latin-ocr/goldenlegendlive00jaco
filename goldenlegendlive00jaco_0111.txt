bishop of Hippo, heard his renomee and fame, he

ten chosen to be bishops, And because the said
bishop was a Greek and but little lettered and taught
in Latin tongue, he gave power to Augustin for
to preach before himself, against the manner of the
church oriental. And therefore many bishops
despised him, but he raught not if he did it to
be done by the said Augustin, that which he could
not do himself. In that time he convanquished
Fortunatus the Priest, a Manicheam, which was a
heretic, and many other heretics, which namely were
rebaptized Donatists and Manicheans3 all these he
confounded and overcame. Then the blessed
Valerian doubted lest Augustin should be taken
away from him, for to be made and required to be a

should not have been found. And then he impetred
of the archbishop of Carthage that he might cease
and leave his bishopriC, and that he would promote
Augustin to be bishop of the church of Hippo.
But when Augustin'heard that, he refused it utterly
in all manners: nevertheless he was constrained
and so coacted that he took at the last the cure
of the bishopriC.
