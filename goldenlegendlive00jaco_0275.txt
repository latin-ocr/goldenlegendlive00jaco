CAXTON'S INTRODUCTION
PAGE
15. 1. Jerome, Saint and Doctor 01 the Church‚ a Dalmatian,
lived from about A.D. 340 to 420. In pictures he is
usually shown as an ascetic-looking hermit: a
Cardinal's hat and a lion are often his attributes.

4. Austin or Augustine, also a Saint and Doctor‚ a native
of Numidia, born 354, died 430. Till middle life he
was an eager student, but at the same time a slave
to sensual sins, the unworthiness and guilt 01 which
he felt while yet he could not shake himself free.
His mother’s prayers‚ his study of S. Paul's epistles,

Christ; a new social system had emerged from the
ashes 01 the old: that system was founded by God,
was ruled by divine laws, and had the divine promise
of perpetuity.”

6. “ ought to be idle.'' S. Augustine's views on labour
(he wrote a treatise De Opere Μ onachorum) did
not meet the approval of the easy-going Monk in
Chaucer's Canterbmy Tales:

‘¹ Let Austin have his swynke to him reserved.”

16. “ I ne nyste '' : 1 did not know. Double and multiple
negatives (01 which Caxton’s works are full) are
found in the earlier and less refined stages of nearly
all languages‚ and sometimes in the later. “ Nyste ”
is, 01 course, “ne wyste ”; similarly “ nill ’'z“ ne
will '’ :will not.
