received anon health‚ and also did many other
miracles. And when his last days approached, and
he was grieved by long infirmity, then he made

all present he blessed them. And like as our Lord fed
his disciples at supper on Shere-Thursday, he gave to
each of them a morsel of bread, and warned them, as
he was wont to do, to give laud to their Maker. And
the very death which is to all men horrible and

⁴ hateful he admonished them to praise it3 and also he

warned and admonished death to come to him, and
said: ‘Death, my sister, welcome be thou’3 and when
he came at the last hour he slept in our Lord. Of

There was a friar named Augustin, which was
minister and servant in the Labour of the Earth, and
as he was in his last end, and had lost his speech, he
escried suddenly and said : ‘Abide me, father, abide‚
I shall go with thee.' Then the friars demanded him
what he said, and he said: ‘See ye not our father
Francis that goeth unto heaven ?' and anon he slept
in peace, and followed his holy father.
