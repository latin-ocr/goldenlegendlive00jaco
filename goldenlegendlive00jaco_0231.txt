S. THOMAS AQUINAS

S. THOMAS AQUINAS‚ of the order of the friars
preacherS‚ was a right sovereign doctor, high and
of noble lineage‚ which was born in the realm of
Sicily.

He had the world and the vanity thereos in despite,
and for to live in the more holy and clean life he
entered into the order of the friars preacherS. And
after, he was drawn out thereos by his brethren and
was closed up in a chamber in a tower two years,
And because that by menaces ne fair words his
brethren might not change his good purpose ne
revoke it in no manner, they put in to his chamber
a young damsel to the innocent child, for to subvert
his good courage‚ and anon he took a brand of fire,
and drove the damsel out of the chamber‚ which was
come for to deceive him. And after that, he put him
in humble prayerS, devoutly beseeching our Lord that
by his benign grace 116 would always maintain his
chastity‚ Anon as he had made his prayers two
angels in marvellous habit appeared to him, saying
that his prayer was heard of God‚ and they distrained
⁷ him by the reinS‚ saying: ‘ThomaS‚ we be sent to
thee by the commandment of God‚ and in his name
we gird thee with the girdle of chastity‚ which shall
never depart from thee, ne shall be broken.' The

which gift was given to him of special grace, and so
