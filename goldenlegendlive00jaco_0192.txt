1 78 S. Edward

a night appeared to a holy monk, which was abbot
of Rumsey, and bade him go and tell to Harold that
he should overcome his enemieS, the which intended
to destroy and consume this realm of England ; ‘ and
say to him that he dread not, for I shall so conduct
him and his host, that he shall have victory, for Ι
may not see ne suffer this realm of England to be
destroyed. And when thou hast told to him this,
he will not believe thee, wherefore thou shalt prove
thy vision in this manner. Let him think and set
his mind on what thing he will, and thou shalt tell,¹
him what he thinketh, for God shall show that to
thee, and then he shall give credence to thy words)
On the morn the abbot of Rumsey, named AlexiS,
went to king Harold and told to him this vision, and
how he should by the aid of S. Edward overcome his
enemieS. And when he heard it first, he supposed it
had been a fantasy, and when he showed to him his
privy thought, then he gave saith thereto and went to
the battle, howbeit that he was then sick in his groin
«of a pestilence botch ; and slew Tosti, his brother, and
Harold Harfager, and right few or none escaped alive,
from the battle. Wherefore the Englishman thanked
God and S. Edward of their victory.
ln the monastery of Westminster there was a fair
young man which was blind, whom the monks had
ordained to ring the bens, and he had a custom daily
to visit the tomb of S. Edward with certain prayerS.
And on a time as he prayed there, he fell asleep, and
he heard a voice that bade him go and ring to the
last hour. And when he awoke he saw S. Edward¹
going tofore him like a king with a crown on his head,
