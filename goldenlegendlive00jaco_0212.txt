198 S. T homas of Canterbury

anon after, S. Thomas came to Rome on S. Mark's
day at asternoon, and when his caterer should have

bought fish for his dinner because it was fasting day,
he could get none for no money, and came and told
to his lord S. Thomas so, and he bade him buy such
as he could get, and then he bought flesh and made
it ready for their dinner. And S. Thomas was
served with a capon roasted, and his meiny with
boiled meat. And so it was that the pope heard
that he was come, and sent a cardinal to welcome
him, and he found him at his dinner eating flesh, ε
which anon returned and told to the pope how he
¹ was not so perfect a man as he had supposed, for

contrary to the rule of the church he eateth this day γ

flesh. The pope would not believe him, but sent
another cardinal which for more evidence took the
leg of the capon in his kerchief and affirmed the
same, and opened his kerchief tofore the pope, and
he found the leg turned into a fish called a carp.
And when the pope saw it, he said, they were not
true men to say such things of this good bishop.
They said faithfully that it was flesh that he ate.
After this S. Thomas came to the pope and did his
reverence and obedience, whom the pope welcomed‚
and after communication he demanded him what
meat he had eaten, and he said: ‘Flesh as ye have
heard tofore, because he could find no fish and very
need compelled him theret0.' Then the pope under-
stood of the miracle that the capon's leg was turned
into a carp, and of his goodness granted to him and
to all them of the diocese of Canterbury licence to
eat flesh ever after on S. Mark’s day when it falleth
