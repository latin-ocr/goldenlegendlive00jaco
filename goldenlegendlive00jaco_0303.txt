chiefly taken from the philosophy of Aristotle. His
principal work—though he himself describes it as
but a compendium for beginners—is his Summa
Theologica. For clearness of vision and mental gmsp,
for sureness of logic and calm power of synthesis,
this and other writings of the “ Angelic Doctor '' have
never been surpassed. After being involved in the
discredit which fell upon many things mediaeval and
Catholic during the sixteenth, seventeenth, and
eighteenth centufies, their merits have come in our
day to be recognized by capable and candid thinkers
of all philosophie schools.

. Francis of Assisi died in 1226 and was solemnlv

canonized in 1228. In twenty—four years after his
death the friars (frati, freres, ‘¹ brothers ³³) of the order
he had founded numbered no less than two hundred
thousand and were spread over Europe. Neverthe-
less he did not (apparently) corne in time to form the
subject of one of De Voragine’s original biographies.
The gap was soon filled; but it is regrettable that
the biography which Caxton and his assistants
found in the later editions of the Legenda Aurea is
less a well-ordered history than a series of anecdotes‚
and recounts much too briefly the saint’s earlier life.

'the signs of his crucifying '' : the stigmata or marks
of the nails and spear in the hands, feet and side.
That such marks (sometimes accompanied by bleed-
ing) have appeared in the bodies of some holy persons
there can be no reasonable doubt. That, in the case
of these persons or others, natural causes may produce
such markings must also be admitted. That super-
natural causes have sometimes been the sole or
partial explanation there is nothing to disprove,
and there are (in some cases) good reasons for
believing.
