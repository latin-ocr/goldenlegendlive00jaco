S. BRANDON

S. BRANDON, the holy man, was a monk, and born
in Ireland 3 and there he was abbot osa house wherein
were a thousand monks, and there he had a full
strait and holy life in great penance and abstinence,
and he governed his monks full virtuously. And
then within short time after there came to him a
holy abbot that 'night Beryne to visit him, and each
of them was joyful of other. And then S. Brandon
began to tell to the abbot Beryne of many wonders
that he had seen in divers landS, and when Beryne
heard that of S. Brandon, he began to sigh and sore
weep3 and S. Brandon comforted him the best wise
he could, saying: ‘Ye come hither for to be joyful
with me3 and therefore for God's love leave your
mourning and tell me what marvels ye have seen
in the great sea-ocean that compasseth all the world
about, and all other waters come out of him which
runneth in all parts of the earth.' And then Beryne
began to tell to S. Brandon and to his monks the
marvels that he had seen, full sore weeping‚ and
said: ‘I have a son, his name is Mervok, and he was
a monk of great fame, which had great desire to
seek about by ship in divers countries to find a
solitary place wherein he might dwell secretly, out
of the business of the world, for to serve God quietly

with more devotion3 and Ι counselled him to sail
