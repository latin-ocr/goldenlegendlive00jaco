220 S. T homas Aquinas

As on a night this glorious doctor was in his
orisons and prayerS‚ the blessed apostles Peter

and Paul appeared to him and induced him in
holy scripture, and especially of the prophecy of
prophetS.

This then is a holy doctor to whom the chancellor
of heaven and the doctor of divine scripture have
opened the gate ; and he that was ravished to heaven
hath shewed to him the secret of all the verity. And
thus this blessed doctor is taken from the world and
made burgess of heaven he being yet in the earth.

On another time as he was in the convent ot

V his order at NapleS‚ being in the church in devout

prayers he was enhanced and lifted up from the
ground the height of two cubits and more. Then a
friar that saw him was much abashed and amarvelled‚
and after was heard a clear voice of the image of the
crucifix tofore whom the holy man was turned and
made his prayer, the which voice said unto him: ‘O
ThomaS, thou hast. written well of me, what reward
wilt thou have for thy labour?' S. Thomas answered to*
him z ‘Lord‚ Ι will none other reward but thyself.’
And as he was sent for of the Pope Gregory the
tenth, he went by Champagne into the realm of
Sicily3 he began to be sick in such wise that he
lost entirely his appetite. And in passing by the
abbey called Fossenew of the order of the Cistercian3‚
he was prayed greatly of the monks that it would
please him to come to their abbey. His sickness
began for to increase from day to day, and yet
notwithstanding his malady he ceased not to sow
and spread his holy doctrine of divine scripture
