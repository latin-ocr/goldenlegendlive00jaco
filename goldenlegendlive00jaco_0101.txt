nature, another of overmuch plenty of meam, and the
third of the devil.'

On a time as S. Anthony was in the wilderness
in his prayer and was weary, he said to our Lord:
‘Lord‚ Ι have great desire to be saved, but my
thoughts let me.' Then appeared an angel to him
and said: ‘Do as I do, and thou shalt be safe‚' and
he went out and saw him one while labour and
γ another while pray.

It happed on a time that S. Anthony laboured
with his brethren the hermitS‚ and he saw a vision
much sorrowful, and therefore he kneeled down on
his knees and prayed our Lord that he would empesh
the great sorrow that was to come. Then the other
hermits demanded what thing it waS‚ and he said
that it was a great sorrow: ‘for I have seen great
plenty of beasts which environed me, which feared
all the country, and I wot well that this is to say
that there shall come a great trouble of men like unto
beastS, that shall defoul the sacraments of holy
church.' Then came a voice from heaven to
S. Anthony that said that ‘great abomination shall
come to mine altar.' And anon after, the heresy of
Arians began, and much troubled holy church‚ and
did many evils, and slew christian men like sheep
upon the altars.

At the last S. Anthony assembled the hermits and
gave to thern the peace, and died and departed out
of this world holily when he was of the age os an

hundred and five years, Pray we to him that he
pray for us,
