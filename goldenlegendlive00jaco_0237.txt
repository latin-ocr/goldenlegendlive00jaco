beset with precious 5101155, and about his neck two
collarS, one of silver, the other of gold, and on his
breast he had a great stone which of his brightness
cast out many rays of clearness and illumined all the
church3 his eope that he had on was full of precious
5101155, 1115 coat and scapulary were all shining of
whiteneSS. When the friar saw this sight he marvelled
much. Then he, that was „kin the habit of a bishop,
said to him: ‘I am Austin, that am sent to thee to

Thomas AquinaS‚ which 15 111 heaven in glory like

other signs and miracles hath our Lord showed
unto the honour and glory of his glorious saint,
S. ThomaS, whose merits be unto us aidant and
helping. Amen.
