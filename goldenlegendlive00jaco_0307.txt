Clare was at once the unswerv ingly loyal disciple
01 Francis and his trusted counsellor. Even against
the well meant relaxations offered by popes she
gently persisted in maintaining for her nuns his
ideal of perfect poverty. At her convent in Assisi
is still preserved as a precious relic and charter
the unique p‘rivilege¹' which she obtained from
Gregory IX. ——the privilege that her‘ ‘Poor Clares’'
(as they were afterwards called) should never be
compelled to accept possessione or revenues. It was
5116 who encouraged Francis in his greatest difficulties,
and urged him 10 continue his mission 10 1116 people
at a time when he thought 1115 vocation lay rather
in a life of solitude and prayer. Her character
seems to have combined great strength with gentle-
ness. Her spiritual children in many places at the
present day still maintain the 511101 poverty which she·
taught them to cherish.
