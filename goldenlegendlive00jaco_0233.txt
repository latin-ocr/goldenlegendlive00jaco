S. Thomas Aquinas 219

then is well a holy doctor, for thus as he set not his
thought in this world, he set all his heart and his
thought toward God, and was enhanced 35 116 that
had not had no flesh ne bone ne any weight. We
read that when the blessed doctor desputed, read, or
wrote, or argued, or did some other virtuous thing, [the
first thing that he did was to pray to God,] and after
when his prayer was past, anon he had in his mouth
that which he should dispute or write as if he had
tofore long studied in many books, All which
things he shewed secretly to his fellow, named friar
Reynold. To whom privily 116 shewed all his other
secrets as long as he lived, and would that none
other should know it, to the end that the vain glory
os the world should not surprise him. For the
science that he had was not of human study, but
was of the administration divine by the prayers and
service that he did to our Lord. This holy man is
then as Moses waS, which was given to the daughter
of Pharaoh. For like as 116 was taken out of the
, 563 and saved and rendered unto the said daughter,
right so the blessed doctor, notwithstanding that he
was born of the great lineage of the Earl of Aquin
was by the purveyance of God rendered to his mother
holy church, and cast out of the flood of this world,
and enhanced and nourished by the 9395 and
mammels of the scripture of holy church. And like
’35 Μο565 made many marvellous signs tofore the
children of Israel, in like wise hath· this blessed
doctor and his science and blessed doctrine in
destroying errors always preached verity and truth,
⁴as his holy lise witnesscth.
