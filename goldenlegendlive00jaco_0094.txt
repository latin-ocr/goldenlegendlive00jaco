S. MACARIUS

S. MACARIUS was in a desert3 and entered in to a pit
or sepulchre, whereas had been buried many bodies
of paynims, for to sleep, and he drew out one of these
bodies and laid it under his head instead of a pillow.
Then came thither devils for to make him aghast

Ι and afeard, and said one to another: ‘Come with me

to bathe thee.' And the body that lay under his
head said: ‘1 may not come, for Ι have a pilgrim
upon me lying‚ that Ι may not move.' For all this
S. Macarius was not afeard‚ but he beat the body
with his fist, and said: ‘Arise and go if thou mayst.’
When the devils saw that they might not make him
afeard they cried with a great voice: ‘MacariuS, thou

‚ hast vanquished and overcome us twice) On a time

as Macarius was nigh his house, the devil came with
a great scythe on his neck, and would have smitten
therewith S. MacariuS, and the devil said to him:
‘ Thou dost to me great violence and force, for Ι may
not prevail against thee. Lo! what thou doest I do;
thou fastest and Ι eat not, thou wakest and I never
sleep: but there is one thing in which thou over-
comest me.’ And Macarius said: ‘What is thatP' To
whom the devil said: ‘That is humility‚ and thy
meekne55‚ by which Ι may not prevail against thee!
It happed on a time that a great temptation came

upon S. MacariuS‚ and much tempted him, and anon
