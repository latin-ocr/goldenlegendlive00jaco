into an yland far in the sea, beside the mountain of
stones which is full well known, and then he made
him ready and sailed thither with his monks, And
when he came thither he liked that place full well,
where he and his monks served our Lord full
devoutly)

And then Beryne saw in a vision that this monk
Mervok was sailed right far eastward in the sea,
more than three days’ sailing, and suddenly to his
seeming there carne a dark cloud and overcovered
thern, that a great part of the day they saw no light, ’

- and as our Lord would, the cloud passed away and

they saw a full fair yland, and thitherward they
drew. In that yland was joy and mirth enough, and
the earth of that yland shined as bright as the sun,
and there were the fairest trees and herbs that ever
any man saw, and there were many precious stones
shining bright, and every herb there was full of
flowerS‚ and every tree full of fruit, so that it was a
glorious sight and a heavenly joy to abide there.
And there, there carne to them a fair young man,
and full courteously he welcomed them all, and called
every monk by his name, and said that they were
much bound to praise the name of our Lord Jesu‚
that would of his grace show to them that glorious
place where is ever day and never night, and this
place is called Paradise terrestrial. By this yland
is another yland wherein no man may come, and
this young man said to them: ‘Ye have been here
half a year without meat, drink, or sleep’3 and they
supposed that they had not been there the space of
half an bour, so merry and joyful they were there.
