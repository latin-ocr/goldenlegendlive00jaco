Bisqmplaz'cal Introduction 7
. Of his GOldeqgend Caxton tells us something
1n his introduction. He derived its substance (he

tells us) from three som„ „ssone Latin, one French,
and one English. The Frenc- was his usual original,

Misprints or mistakes occurring in the wsench have
not been set right by reference to the souma· but are

none ’! It must be said, however, that such blunders
are not frequent, and Caxton might plead more than
one excuse for his shortcomings Of the English
precursor whom Caxton drew upon we know nothing ε
