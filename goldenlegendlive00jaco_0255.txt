S. Clare 241

was over foul, that she should use to lie on a sack
full of straw. Tenthly‚ how she hath despised the
iniquity of the fiend our enemy, it is read that in
especial she had a custom that from mid-day 5116

sufferance of Jesu Christ, two hours during, and
after the eventide she was always a long while in

and thinking 011 1116 sufferance of our Lord Jesu
Christ 50 burningly, that she was ravished 35 311
drunken in the love of God‚ that she knew not
what was said ne done about her, but as unmovable
or 35 311 insensible, in standing she held her eyes
