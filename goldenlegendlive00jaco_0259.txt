S. Clare 245

city besieged for to have been taken. And when
S. Clare, the handmaid of Jesu Christ, heard the
tidings‚ she had great pity and did do call her‘
sisters and said to them: ‘Right sweet daughterS,
we receive daily many benefits of this city, and it
should be a great unkindness in us if we succoured
it not in this great need as much as we may.' Then
commanded she to bring asheS, and said to her
sisters that they should discover their heads‚ and
she herself first cast great plenty of ashes upon
her head, and after, upon the heads of all the others,
and said to them : ‘ Now go, fair daughterS, and with
all your hearts require and pray ye to our Lord that
he will deliver this city? And then every each by
themselveS, in great weepings and tearS, made their
orisons and prayers devoutly to our Lord, in such
wise that he kept and defended the city, that on the
morn the host departed out of the country, and it
was not long after that they all were dead and slain.

It should not be according that we should hele
and keep secret the marvellous virtue of her prayer,
by the which at the beginning of her conversion she
converted 3 soul to God. For she had a sister
younger than herself waS, whose conversation she
much desired, and in all her prayers that she made
she prayed at the beginning with all her heart to our
Lord that like as she and her sister had been in the
world of one heart and of one will, that it might
please the Father of mercy that AgneS‚ her sister,
whom she had left in the world, might despise the
world, and savour the sweetness of God, so that she
might have no will to marry her, save only to God
