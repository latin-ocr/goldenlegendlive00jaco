The high ideals‚ devotion and asceticism of the
eremitical or monastic life appealed to Augustine.
Anthony and his fellow-hermits, the “children and
maidens ’' who served God perpetually in the churches,
their bodily self-denial‚ their voluntary poverty,
their obedience‚ stimulated to a complete triumph
over sensuality one not born for half measures.
At his death he left to his diocese, according to his
biographer Possidius, “ monasteries of men and
women well supplied with superiors and subjects,” to
keep alive this sacred fire which had warmed himself.

conversion is given by Augustine as follows τ Non in
comessationibus et ebrietatibus, non in cubilibus et
impudicitiis, non in contentione et oemulatione: sed
induimini Dominum Jesuin Christum, et carnis
curam ne feceritis in desideriis .· “ Not in revellings
and drunkenness, not in forbidden and impure
indulgences, not in contention and jealousy: but
put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ and provide not for
the flesh to excite its desires’' (S. Paul, Rom. xiii.
13 and 14).

Isaiah . . . he deferred to read.’' Ego primani
hujus lectionem non intelligens, totumque talem
arbitrans, distuli repetendum exercitatior in dominico
eloquio (Confess. ix. 5).

(The construction of exercitatior is curicus.) In
the fifth and sixth books of his Confessions Augustine
had already told of his endeavours to arrive with the
help of S. Ambrose and others at a right under-
standing of the Holy Scriptures. Of the difficulties
of such an endeavour he retained a humble conviction
to the end of his life. “ Great is the depth of thy
words,'' he exclaims (Conf. xiii. ch. 14), “ their
surface lies before us, tempting little ones: but
great is their depth, O my God, and to gaze deep
into them fills the soul with awe, with a trembling
veneration, with a loving fear.” In harmony with
this feeling were the anxious desires he constantly
manifested for a correct canon of the sacred books

and for interpretations in accordance with the mind
of the Church.
