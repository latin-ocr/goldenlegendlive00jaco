S. Α ustz‘n 9 5

then, as it is read, S. Ambrose said: ‘Te Deum
laudamuS,' and S. Austin answered: ‘Te dominum
confitemur,' and so they two together ordained and
made this hymn and sung it unto the end. And so
witnesseth it Honorius in his book which is named,

with thy charity, and I have borne thy words fixed
in mine entraiIS, and the ensamples of thy servantS,
which thou hast made of black, white and shining,
and of dead, living; and of corrupt thoughts thou

heavenly things, I mounted up into the hill of
weeping, and thou gavest to me, singing the canticle

truth hath dropped in mine heart, and then tears
have run down and Ι was well cased with them.
And I cried with an high cry of mine heart: O in
pace, O z'n id zpsum3 O thou that sayest I shall sleep
