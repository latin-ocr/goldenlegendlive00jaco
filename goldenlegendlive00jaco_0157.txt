mantle and laid it upon the stream of the said well,
and from thence it was brought unto this holy man
Beun0‚ through the waves of the sea, by the pur-
veyance of God. After this, the blessed virgin
Winifred increased from day ‘co day in great virtue
and goodneSS‚ and specially in holy contemplation
with her sisters‚ moving them into great devotion
and love of Almighty God. And when she had
abode there seven yearS‚ she departed thence and
went to the monastery called Wytheriacu5‚ in which
were both men and women of virtuous and holy
conversation. And when she had confessed and told
her life unto the holy abbot EleriuS, he received her
honourably and brought her to his mother, Theonia‚
a blessed woman which had the rule and charge of
all the sisters of that place ; and when Theonia was
deceased out of this world, this holy abbot Elerius
delivered to this holy virgin &Vinifred the charge of
the sisters; but she refused it as long as she might.
But by constraint she took the charge, and lived
afterward a virtuous life and more straiter and
harder than she did tofore in giving good ensample
to all her sisterS. And when she had continued
there in the service of God eight year5‚ she yielded
ν up her spirit to her maker‚ to whom let us pray to
be a special intercessor for us, Arnen.
