reverencing the name of S. Benedict '' (Imperial
Dici. of Universal Biography). In addition to the
cares of religion and letters, manual labour of all
kinds came within the Benedictine scope. “ We
owe the agricultural restoration of great part of
Europe to the monks‚” says Hallam. They were,
according to Guizot, “ the agriculturists of Europe;
they cleared it on a large scale ''; they drained
morasses, made roads, and built bridges. With
monasteries of men grew also those for women, like
that presided over by his sister S. Scholastica. “ In
them the gentle arts were cultivated and women found
a refuge from the rude violence of turbulent ages.’'

life. Augustine saw what was right in faith and
morals, but was not therefore converted. In his
writings he constantly dwells on the doctrine that
light of the intellect, however bright, is not necessarily
accompanied or followed by the gift of faith, much
less by virtuous action; that the gift and virtue
of faith, though resting on an intellectual foundation,
is gained and held only by the human will in co-
operation with divine grace.
