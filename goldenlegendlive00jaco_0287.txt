must admit the possibility or probability of our
coming from time to time into momentous and
conscious contact with that world. But as to the
frequency and character os actual cases of contact‚
as well as about particular instances alleged, there
may be wide differences of opinion.

Or the eremetical life in general a word should
perhaps here be said. That manner of lise was a
human attempt to reproduce one portion of the
example given by the Divine Model——that oi His forty
days' fast and temptation in the wilderness and oi:
His long night-vigils and prayers on the mountain-
sides. In ages very different from ours it had a
singularly strong appeal for earnest men and women.
How strong we may gather from Athanasius’s account
of the effect produced by Anthony's example during
and immediately after his lifetime 1—-

“Among the mountains there were monasteries
as if tabernacles filled with divine choirs, singfflg,
studying‚ tasting, praying‚ exulting in the hope of
things to come, working for alms deeds, having love
and harmony one towards another. And truly it
was given to one there to see a peculiar comity oi
piety and righteousness. N either injurer nor injured
was there, nor chiding of the tax—collector; but a
multitude of ascetics, whose one feeling was towards
holiness. So that a stranger‚ seeing the monasteries
and their order, would be led to cry out: ‘ How
beauteous are thy homes, O Jacob, and thy taber-
nacles, O Israel; as shady groves, as a garden on a
river, as tents which the Lord has pitohed, and as
cedars by the waters 1 ' ’¹

Such a tribute to the monastic and contemplative
life is especially interesting as coming from one who
was himself thoroughly a man of zeal, action, and
conflict. See also infra the life os S. Austin for the
sentiments of that Father towards monasticism.

Benedict oi Nursia, looked on as the patriarch of
Western Monasticism, flourished in the beginning
of the sixth century A.D. “ The history oi the Order
which bears his name is an important part of the
history oi European civilization. From the period
when he impressed on monastic life that character
of activity in arts and letters and simplicity in
matters of devotion, . . . monasteries became
equally the refuge of learning and piety. Admiring
