S. Francis oi Assisi nine centuries later was reluctant

to destroy insects, however annoying ; but his feeling 2
was a different one; it was predominantly that oi -j
unwillingness to inflict pain and death on creatures ⁴,

oi God that are so marvellously made and that pro-

claim in so many ways His goodness. The eyes of ³
Macarius would see in the world a desert oi exile and -
a field of. battle against sensuality and worldliness— ’-
a place where small sufferings should be despised and · ³,
great ones magnanimously accepted. The eyes of ,

Francis would see in all creatures, great and small,
a vast family bound in chains oi love to one
another and to the throne oi one Heavenly Father.

S. ANTHONY

84. 1. Anthony was born in Egypt about the year A.D. 250.

The facts of his life were handed down to posterity
Ῑέγὲξὲἃὲἓὲῗέἓουὸ writer and defender of orthodoxy,

85. 4. “all to-rent his body‚” ete. ε tore in pieces his body so Ἰ
that he supposed he was certain to die.

87. 13. “empesh”: prevent. French empe‘cher, Lat. impedicare. ¹
“Did I see him before me‚” says Newman (in his “
chum-h of the Fathers, Anthony in Coufflict), ‘¹ I might
be tempted‚ with my cut and dried opinions, and my
matter of fact ways, and my selfishness and pusil-
lanimity, to consider him somewhat of an enthusiast ;

but what Ι desire to point out is . . . the subdued j

and Christian form which was taken by his enthusi-
asm, if it must be so called. It was not vulgar,
bustling‚ imbecile, unstable‚ undutiful; it was
calm and composed, manly‚ intrepid‚ magnanimous,
full of affectionate loyalty to the Church and to the
Truth.'' “ Superstition‚’' he again says, “is abject

and crouching; it is full of thoughts oi guilt; it .'

distrusts God‚ and dreads the powers of evil. Anthony
at least had nothing of this, being full of holy con·
fidence‚ divine peace, cheerfulness and valorousnessf'

In what has been preserved of his discourses and

counsels as well as in many anecdotes related of ’ς’
him, we are impressed by his good sense, urbanity ἐ,

and gentleness.

In his conflicts with evil spirits, there is little ’
that a student os Holy Scripture will look upon as ÷

new or strange. As to the objective reality of such

experiences it is rash to dogmatize, either in general ,
