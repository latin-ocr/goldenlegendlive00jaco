he filled a sack full of stoneS‚ and laid it on his
neck and bare it many journeys together through
the desert. Then another hermit met him and de-
manded him why he bare so great a burden, and he
answered: ‘I travail. my body because it suffereth not
me in peace, and thus I vex him that vexed me.’
This holy abbot S. Macarius saw passing tofore
him a devil in the habit of a man, which was the
clothing of a herald, all linen full of holeS, and in
every hole hung a pyolle‚ and he demanded him
whether he went. The devil answered him, Ι go for
to give drink unto these hermits; then demanded
him S. MacariUS, wherefore he bare so many pyolles,
And he answered: ‘I shall offer to them one, and if
he may not drink of that one, Ι shall proffer him
another, and so the third, and of all the other, each
after other, until they may find something pleasant
to them for to fall into temptation.' And when he
came again, S. Macarius called him, and demanded
him what he had found, and he answered that he had
evil sped‚ for they were all so holy and blessed that
they recked not of his drink, save one only which is
named Theodistus. Then S. Macarius arose and
came to these hermitS, and found them all in good
point save him whom the devil had tempted. Then
S. Macarius did so much by his exhortation that he
brought him again in the right way. Another time
S. Macarius met the devil and demanded him whence
he came, and the devil answered: ‘I come from visit-
ing thy brethren.' Then said S. Macarius: ‘ How do
they?’ The devil answered: ‘Evi1.’ And he asked

wherefore, and the devil said : ‘ For they be all holy‚
