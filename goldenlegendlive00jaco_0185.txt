S. Edward 171

was like to stand in after his decease. Then all
things were committed to the queen, whom he
loved specially, and she full diligently ministered to
him all things necessary. And when he was so
feeble by sickness that his natural heat was almost
gone, he lay nigh two days in a trance, as a man
that had been ravished3 and when he came to him-
self again they that were about him marvelled
greatly, for they weened verily that he should no
more have spoken. N otwithstanding after, he spake
with a noble spirit these words: ‘O thou merciful
Lord God, that art infinite Almighty‚ in whose
power all things be put, which changest realms and
empires; if those things be true that thou hast
showed to me, so grant me space and strength to
declare them to my people‚ that if peradventure
they give thern to penance they may have grace and
forgiveness? Then Almighty God gave to him a
new strength that passeth 311 man's reason, and that
might not be without miracle3 for before that time he
spake so soft that for feebleness he might not well
be heard, and at that time he spake with a whole
breast these words following: ‘When Ι was young
and dwelled in Normandy‚ Ι loved well the fellow-
ship of good men, for he that spake most religiously
and goodly, with him was I most conversant. And
among all others there were twain to whom I drew
much for their honest conversation, and for the
holiness of their life, sweetness of their manners and
their comfortable wordS, whom Ι saw translated into
heaven; for many years gone they died, and now
they have appeared to me by the sufferance of God
