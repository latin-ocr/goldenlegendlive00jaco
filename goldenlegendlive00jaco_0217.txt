S. Thomas of Canterbury 203

before the altar on the head. And one Sir Edward
Grim‚ that was his crozier, put forth his arm with the
cross to bear off the stroke, and the stroke smote the
cross asunder and his arm almost off 3 wherefore he
fied for sear, and so did all the monks, that were
that time at compline. And then smote each at
him, that they smote off a great piece of the skull of
his head, that his brain fell on the pavement. And
so they slew and martyred him, and were so crue]
that one of them brake the point of his sword against
the pavement. And thus this holy and blessed
Archbishop S. Thomas suffered death in his own
chureh for the right of all holy church. And when
he was dead they stirred his brain, and after went in
to his chamber and took away his goodS‚ and his
horse out of his stable‚ and took away his bulls and
writingS, and delivered them to Sir Robert Broke to
bear into France to the king. And as they searched
his chamber they found in a chest two shirts of hair
made full ofgreat knotS‚ and then they said : ‘Certainly
he was a good man’3 and coming down into the
churchyard they began to dread and sear that the
ground would not have borne them, and were
marvellously aghast, but they supposed that the
earth would have swallowed them all quick. And
then they knew that they had done amisa And
anon it was known all about how that he was
martyred‚ and anon after took this holy body and
unclnthed him and found bishop's clothing above
and tm: habit of a monk under. And next his flesh
he wore hard hair, full of knots, which was his shirt·
And he was thus martyred the year of our Lord one
