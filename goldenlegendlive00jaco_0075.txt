S. Dorothy 6 1

of virtueS, the sixth day of February, the year of our
Lord two hundred and eighty-eight, by FabriciuS,
provost under Diocletian and Maximian emperors of
Rome. And as this said Theophilus stood in the
palace of the emperor, this child came to him and
presented to him the basket, saying: ‘These be the
roses and apples that my sister Dorothy hath sent to
thee from Paradise, the garden of her spouse,' and
then this child vanished away. Then he, considering
the marvellous work of God in this holy virgin, said
anon with a stern voice, praising the God of Dorothy
for that great miracle which was showed to him of
roses and apples that time, that ‘he that sent to me
these things is of great power, and therefore his name
be blessed world without end, Amen! And then he
was converted to the saith of Jesu Christ, and the
most part of the people of the city. And when
Fabricius knew this, anon, with great medice, he
tormented Theophilus the scribe with many divers
tormentS, and at the last hewed him into small
pieceS‚ and the pieces were cast to birds and beasts
to be devoured. But he was first baptized and
received the holy sacrament, and followed the holy
virgin Dorothy into the bliss of heaven.
