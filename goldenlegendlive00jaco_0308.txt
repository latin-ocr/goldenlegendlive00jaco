APPENDIX

PUNCTUATION AND STYLE IN CAXTON

In Caxton’s day a very simple system of punctuation har-
monized with a much looser and less caret'ully ordered syntax
than has become familiar to us in the prose of modern English
writers. The complexities of punctuation have kept pace with
the subtler shadings of syntactical arrangement. The appli-
cation in modern editions of authors such as Caxton of the
refined methods of modern punctuation renders the reading of

them more easy and pleasant to us ; but has the disadvantage

of disguising from us not a little the essential simplicity and
fluid syntax os fifteenth-century style—at least of Caxton's.
' These characteristics can only be realized when we have imagined
away the punctuation or all but its simplest marks. Having,
therefore, used modern punctuation throughout this edition,
we think it desirable to append here a passage in literal trans-
·cription from a first edition of Caxton's own, with a view to

illustrating the methods and syntactical effects of the original
Caxtonian punctuation:

Certes hyt is a foule vyce in a preest the synne of couetyse l
But fewe haue ben to fore thys tyme s and fewe ben yet but yf
they ben attaynte therwyth l whereof hyt is grete pyte l syn hyt
is so that auaryce is moder of aii vyces l Whih's that the troians
gadryd to gyder their gold and syluer and put hyt in the temple
of mynerve to kepe vnto the tyme that hyt was alle assemblid.
Hit playsid them to ofire ἃ make sacrefyse to theyr god Appolyn s
And whan they hadd slayn many bestes for their sacrefyce and
had put them vpon the Awter l And hadd sette syre on them
for to brenne them s Hit happend that ther cam there two mer·
uayllis s the fyrste was that the syre wold not alyghte ne brenne s
ior they began to make the syre more than ten tymes l And
alway hyt quenchid and myght neuer brenne the sacrefyce.
The seconde myracle or meruaylle was whan they had appoynted
the entraylles of the bestes for theyr sacrefyce s A grete Eygle
descended fro the ayer cryyng gretly and toke wyth his feet the
said entraylles and bare hem in to the shyppes of the grekes.
