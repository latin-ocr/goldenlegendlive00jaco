S. Clare 253

This blessed S. Clare was a good mistress and
true for to inform young people that knew but little
of religion, and she was president and upperest of
the maidens of our Lord‚ and informed them in
good customS. She nourished them by so great love
that unnethe any tongue may express ; she taught
them privily to fiee all noise of the world, because
they should join to our Lord‚ and also she exhorted
them that they should put from them all carnal affec-
tion and fleshly love of their friendS‚ and that they
should not be over tender over them ne love them
over much, ne houseS, ne land3 but make them
strong to please and serve God. She counselled
them and warned them that they should hate to do
the will of the body, and that the delights and fleshly
desires of the flesh they should with all their heart
and good reason go thereagainst. She said to them
the fiend of hell lieth in await and layeth his hooks and
ginnes subtilly for to take and bind the holy sou15,
and yet they tempt more the good people than them
of the world. She would that they should work and
labour with their proper hands in such works as she
had established to them, She would that when they
had done their bodily travail they should go to
prayer, for prayer is a thing that pleaseth much God.
And she would that in praying they should rechaufe
their bodieS, and that they should leave and depress
negligence and all coldness of heart, and be kindled
and lighted in the holy love of God‚ so that instead
of coldness they should be hot in devotion. In no
place ne in no cloister was silence better kept ne
holden, there was no lavas in their speech ne evil,
