ing, and having pity on them that were nigh dead,
kneeled down to the earth, and remembering the
new canonisation of the biessed S. LouiS‚ sore weep-
ing, made for the foresaid men his prayer to him,
and after his prayer was done he saw foll< coming
that way. He called them, and forthwith they delved
with such staves as they had, so much that by the
merits of the saint to whom they trusted much, they
had out of the quarry the foresaid ten men, the which
were found unhurt, and as whole as ever they were
before, howbeit that in certain they were dead.

It happed on another time that a great wall fell

’ on a child which was reputed as dead by all the folk,

stones that covered him to be had away, and found
her child laughing and whole of all his memberS.
A woman aggrieved with a sickness which men call
the fire of S. Anthony came to Poissy, thereas
S. Louis was born, and before the font wherein the
said saint was baptized, she kneeled‚ and sore weep-
ing made her prayer there to God and to the saint,
by the merits of whom her body was clean delivered
from the foresaid sickness Item two days after this,
a worshipful man which of long time had been
oppressed and beaten with sickness of feet, that he
could not go ne stand without he had two crutches
or staves under his armS‚ came unto the said font,
made there his prayer, left his staves there, and home
he returned as whole as ever he was, And yet sithe
were there and are as now done many other miracles
through the prayers and merits of S. Louis to the

glory and praising of our Redeemer.
