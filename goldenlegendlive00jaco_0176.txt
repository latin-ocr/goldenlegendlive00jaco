yet moist and appeared newly done. Then the
bishop believed this thing verily, and said mass that
same day in the church, and there preaehed to the
people a glorious sermon, and declared the great
miracle openly. Wherefore the people gave laud
and praisings to God and to his glorious apostle
S. Peter.

And then S. Edward understood that this church
was of old time hallowed by S. Peter, and how
S. Peter had commanded him to repair the same
church, as the letter of the recluse maketh mention. Ὺ
So then ever after he had full great devotion to the ¹

’ same place. And he did do cast down the old

work, and did do build it up new, and endowed that
monastery worshipfully with livelihood and jeweIS.
On a time when the king was in the church of
S. Peter at Westminster‚ and was disposed in great
devotion, as his custom waS, to hear mass, Earl
Leofric kneeled behind the king and saw with his
bodily eyes our Lord Jesu Christ between the priest’s
handS, appearing in the likeness of a glorious child
or beauteous person which blessed the king with his
right hand. And the king, which was greatly com-
forted with the sight, bowed down his head, and with
great devotion and meekness received the blessing of
our Lord. Then the earl arose to tell the king, sup-
posing that the king had not seen it, but he knew
the earl's intent and bade him stand still, ‘for that
thou seest I see, and him I honour.’ And when mass
was done they talked together of their vision, and
they were marvellously refreshed with the gifts of
the Holy Ghost‚ and might not well speak for joy
