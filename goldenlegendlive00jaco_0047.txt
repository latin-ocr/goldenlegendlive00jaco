S. Thomas the Apostle 3 3

said: ‘Lol see ye that Ι worship, but not the idol;
Ι adore, but not the metal; Ι worship, but not the
false image, but Ι honour and worship my Lord Jesu
Christ in the name of whom I command thee, devil‚
which art hid within this image, that thou break this
false idol.' And anon he molt it as waX. And then
the priests came lowing as beastS, and the bishop of
the temple lift up a glaive and run the apostle through
and said: ‘I shall avenge the injury of my god.'
And the king and Carisius fled away, for they saw
that the people would avenge the apostle and burn
the bishop all alive. And the christian men bare
away the body of the apostle and buried it worship-
fully. Long time aster, about the year of our Lord
two hundred and thirty, the body of the apostle was
borne into Edessa, the city which sometime was said
RageS, city of Media3 and Alexander the Emperor
bare it thither at the request of the SyrianS.

Isidore, in the book of the Life of the SaintS‚ saith
thus of this apostle: ‘ ThomaS, apostle and disciple of
our Lord Jesu Christ, and like unto our Saviour,
preached the Gospel unto miscreantS, to them of
Persia and of Media, to the Hircanians and BactrianS‚
and he entering into the parts of the Orient‚ pierced
through the entrails of the people. There demened
his predication unto the title of his passion, and there
was he pierced with a glaive and so died? And
Chrysostom saith that when Thomas came in to the
parts of the three kings which came to worship our
Lord he baptized them, and they were made helpers
and aiders of our Lord and of christian saith.
