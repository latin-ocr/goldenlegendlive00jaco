age on food allowances which might seem to us to
exceed hardly a starvation limit. S. Romuald‚ the
founder of the austere Camaldolese monks, appears
to have lived to the age ot 120; S. Gilbert of
Sempringham to 106. S. Paul and S. Antony, the
first hermits, were centenarians. The modern S.
Alphonsus Lignori, who, in addition to extreme
asceticism, made a vow never to lose time and kept
it, lived to be 92 and met death in full possession of
his mental iaculties. And we do not speak of
Orientals.

. ‘ over-foul.'' Cleanliness was to be looked to, even

amid Franciscan mortifications and poverty. It is
a common error to imagine that the Christianity or
monasticism of primitive and mediaeval times was
systematically or usually indifferent to cleanliness.
At least as many facts may be quoted to dispel that
opinion as to support it. Saints, no doubt, despised
cleanliness in comparison with what they knew to
be greater concerns, but in itself they valued it as
a symbol and fitting companion ot soul-purity. In
their Rules they eonstantly encouraged and recom-
mended order and cleanliness in all that concerned
the religious house and its inmates.

What a mediaeval bishop thought of Saturday-
night “ washings-up ” and neat Sunday clothes may
be gathered from this fragment of a twelith-century
biogra hy :—

“ Itpis the custom of Christians, venerating every-
where Sunday on account of our Lord's resurrection,
on Saturdays rather than on other days to cleanse
and refresh the body after the fatigues and sweats of
labour, and to change soiled clothes for washed ones ;
that so with bodies as well as hearts the purer they
may enter the Church, which is the earthly court of
their King.'' (St Melanius ; Bollandists‚ I. 334.)

the Last Supper ; from the words “ Mandatum
novum do vobis '' : I give you a new commandment.
