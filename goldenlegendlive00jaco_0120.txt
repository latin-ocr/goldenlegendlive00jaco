all this water of the sea into this pit.’ ‘ What ?' said
he3 ‘it is impossible3 how may it be done, sith the
sea is so great and large, and thy pit and spoon so
little?’ ‘YeS, forsooth,’ said he; ‘I shall lightlier
and sooner draw all the water of the sea and bring
it into this pit than thou shalt bring the mystery of
the Trinity and his divinity into thy little under-
standing as to the regard thereos 3 for the mystery
of the Trinity is greater and larger to the comparison
of thy wit and brain than is this great sea unto this ²
J little pit.' And therewith the child vanquished away.
Then here may every man take ensample that no
man, and especially simple lettered men, ne un-
learned‚ presume to intermit ne to muse on high
things of the godhead‚ farther than we be informed
by our saith, for our only saith shall suffice us,

Then herewith Ι make an end of the life of this
glorious doctor S. Austin, to whom let us devoutly
pray that he be a mediator and advocate unto the
blessed Trinity, that we may amend our sinful life
in this transitory world, that when we shall depart
we may come to everlasting bliss in heaven. Amen.
