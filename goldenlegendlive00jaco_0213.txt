S. T hom-as of Canterbury 199

on a fish day‚'and pardon withal; which is kept and
accustomed unto this day. And then S. Thomas
informed the pope how the king of England would
have him consent to divers articles against the
liberties of holy church, and what wrongs he did to
the same, and that for to die he would never consent
to them. And when the pope had heard him he
wept for pity, and thanked God that he had such a
bishop under him that had so well defended the
liberties of holy church‚ and anon wrote out letters
and bulls commanding all the bishops of Christ-
endom to keep and observe the same. And then
S. Thomas offered to the pope his bishopric up into
the pope’s hand, and his mitre with the cross and
ring, and the pope commanded him to keep it still, and
said he knew no man more able than he waS. And
after S. Thomas said mass tofore the pope in a white
chasuble ; and after mass he said to the pope that he
knew by revelation that he should suffer death for
the right of holy church, and when it should fall that
chasuble should be turned from white into red. And
after he departed from the pope and came down into
France unto the abbey of Pounteney3 and there he
had knowledge that when the lords spiritual and
tempora] which had been at Rome were come home
and had told the king that they might in no wise
have their intent, that the king was greatly wroth,
and anon banished all the kinsmen that were longing
to S. Thomas that they should incontinent void his
land, and made them swear that they should go to
him and tell to him that for his sake they were
exiled 3 and so they went over sea to him at Pounteney
