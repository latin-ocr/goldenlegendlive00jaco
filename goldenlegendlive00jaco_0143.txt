S . Gregory 1 29

in Sicily3 and the seventh he founded within the
walls of Rome in the honour of S. Andr-ew the
apostle‚ in the which he became a monk. And the
remnant of his patrimony he gave for God's sake3 50
that he that tofore went clothed in clothes of gold
and of silk, and adorned with precious stones in the
city, when he was monk served in a poor habit the
monkS. There was at the beginning of his conversa-
tion of so perfect a life that it might be said well that
he was all perfect. He made great abstinences in
eating‚ in drinking, in waking, and in praying, in 50
much that he was so travailed that unnethe he might
sustain himself, He had put out of his beart all
secular things, so that his conversation was in heaven,
for he had addressed all his desire for to come to the
joy permanable.

On a time it happed that, S. Gregory in his cell of
the same abbey whereas he was abbot wrote some-
thing, and an angel appeared to him in semblance of
a marines, which seemed as he had escaped from the
tempest of the sea, and prayed him weeping to have
pity on him. Then S. Gregory commanded that
there should be given to him six pence, and then he
departed. The same day the angel came again in
like wise as he did tofore, and said that he had lost
all his good, and prayed him that he would yet help
him; on whom S. Gregory had yet psty, and did to
be given to him six pence rnore; yet at the third
time he came and made great cry and wept‚ and
prayed him that he would yet help him toward his
great loss, 50 that S. Gregory commanded his provost
that he should yet give to this poor man an almS.
