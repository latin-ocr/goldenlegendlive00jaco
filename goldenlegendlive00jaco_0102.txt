S. BENEDICT AND S. SCHOLASTICA

IT happed that S. Benet went to visit his sister,
named Scholastica, and as they sat at table she
prayed her brother that he would abide there all
that night, but he in no wise would grant her, and
said he might not live out of his cloister. And
when she saw that he would not grant to her to

Α abide, she inclined her head and made her prayers

to our Lord, and anon it began to thunder and to
lighten‚ and the air to wax dark which tofore was
fair and clear, and a great rain fell down so that for
nothing he might depart. And like as she wept
with her eyen, right so forthwith the rain and storrn
came, and then she lifted up her head. Then S.
Benet said to his sister: ‘ Almighty God forgive you
that ye have done, for ye have letted me that I may
not depart hence.' And she said: ‘Fair brother,
God is more courteous than ye be, for ye would not
accept my prayer; but God hath heard me. Now go
if ye may.’ And then S. Benet abode there all the
night, speaking of God between him and his sister
without sleeping‚ till they were both eased. On the
morn S. Benet went to his abbey, and on the third
day he list up his eyes to heaven, and saw the soul
of his sister mount up into heaven in the likeness of
a dove. And anon he did the body of her to be
brought to his abbey, and did it to be buried in his

tomlggwhich he had do make for himself.
