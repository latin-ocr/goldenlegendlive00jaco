King Henry II. did public penance for his share in
the murder oi Thomas a Becket‚ and in a very short
time the martyr became an object of the most marked
popular veneration not only in England but over
the continent. For Chaucer and his contemporaries
he was “the holy blisful martir ‘¹ and the goal of
many a pilgrimage. His determined resistanee to
royal enoroachments did not move any ill-will on
the part of English kings till the time of Henry VIII.
It was inevitable that that monareh's career 01
determined efiort to subjugate Churoh and State
should bring him into confliot with all that the great

Legenda Aurea. Its material 15 derived from memoirs

The signs of translation from the Freneh are numerous,
and the style falls below the average of Caxton's Lives.

father was Louis VIIL, his mother Blanche of Castile‚
who, being lest regent after her· husband's death,
