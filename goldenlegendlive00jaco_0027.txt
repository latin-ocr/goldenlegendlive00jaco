Bz'ograplzical Introduction 1 3

The greatest of human teacherS, Aristotle, whom
Sidney here alleges in his support, says z--

The historian and the poet are distinguished by this—that
the one relates what has been, the other what might be. On
this account Poetry is a more philosophica] and more excellent
thing than History. Poetry is chiefly conversant with general

truth 3 History with particular.l

The typical writer of the mediaeval legend might,
therefore, claim the support of Aristotle and Sidney
when he thought it was more ‘excellent and philo-
sophical' to seek the eternal essence and reality of
things than to be eager concerning those particular
and transient realities which veil rather than reveal
eternal truth.

It would detain us too long to consider the many
other ways in which these ancient pages bring us
back into the heart of the Middle Ages and set us in
contact with its thought and religious feeling. They
do not, assuredly‚ show us everything which lay in
that heart: Chaucer‚ to mention but one author, will
afford us much more varied psychological studies.
Still less do they show us external brilliancy or
pomp: for that we may turn to Froissart. But it is
a quite authentic revelation as far as it goeS. And if
the figures may sometimes remind us of the stiffness
and remoteness of those which we see alost in some
well-preserved cathedral window, yet, like these, they
are often shot through with a variety of colours
borrowed from the pulsing and vivid humanity of
the time. Nay more, if they seem to us but faintly
quite as mythical as Virgil’s-—or rather more so. For Virgil himself

was not a myth, but ‘ Dares the Phrygian ' was.
