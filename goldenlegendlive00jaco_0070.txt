S. DOROTHY

THE glorious virgin and martyr S. Dorothy was born
of the noble lineage of the senators of Rome3 her
father hight Theodore. In that time the persecution
of the christen people was great about Rome, where-
fore this holy virgin S. Dorothy, despising the -
worshipping of idols, counselled her father, her

’ mother, and her two sisters, Christine and Celestine,

to forsake their possessions; and so they did, and
fled into the realm of Cappadocia, and came into the
city of Caesarea, wherein they set S. Dorothy to
school, and soon after she was christened of the holy
bishop S. ApollinariuS‚ and he named her Dorothy3
and she was fulfilled with the Holy Ghost, and in
great beauty above all the maidens of that royame.
And she despised all worldly vanitieS, and burned
in the love of Almighty God, and loved poverty‚ and
was full of meekness and chastity; whereof the fiend
having envy at her blessed living provoked and set
afire in her love the provost, so that he would have
her ‘to his wife, and anon sent for her in all haste,
and when she came he desired to have her to his
wife, and promised to her riches of worldly goods
without number. And when this holy virgin under-
stood his desire and request she refused it and denied
it utterly, and all his riches Setting at nought3 and

moreover she acknowledged herself to be christen‚
