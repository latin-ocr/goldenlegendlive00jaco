S. NICHOLAS THE BISHOP

NICHOLAS‚ citizen of the city of PatraS, was born of

his mother Johane. ln his young age he eschewed

honour and glory of God. And it was so that one,
his n'eighbour, had then three 'daughters virginS, and
he was a nobleman: but for the poverty os thern

and threw by night secretly into the house of the
man a mass of gold wrapped in a cloth. And when
the man arose in the morning, he found this mass of

another mass of gold3 which the man found, and
thanked God, and purposed to wake for to know
him that so had aided him in his poverty. And

after a few days Nicholas doubled the mass of gold,
