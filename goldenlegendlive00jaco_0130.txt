1 1 6 S. Brandon

four seats for twenty-four monkS‚ and the seven
tapers burning, and the abbot’s seat was made in
the midst of the quire, and then S. Brandon demanded
of the abbot how long they had kept that silence,
that none of them spake to other, and he said:
‘These twenty-four years we spake never one to
another.’ And then S. Brandon wept for joy of
their holy conversation. And then S. Brandon
desired os the abbot that he and his monks might
dwell there still with him. To whom the abbot
said: ‘Sir, that may ye not do in no wise‚ sor our
Δ Lord hath showed to you in what manner ye shall
be guided till the seven years be fulfilled‚ and after
that term thou shalt with thy monks return into
Ireland in safety‚ but one of the two monks that
came last to you shall dwell in the yland of ankerS,
and that other shall go quick to hell) And as
S. Brandon kneeled in the church he saw a bright
shining angel come in at the window, and lighted all
the lights in the church, and then he flew out again
at the window unto heaven, and then S. Brandon
marvelled greatly how the light burned so fair and
wasted not. And then the abbot said that it is
written that Moses saw a bush all on afire and yet
it burned not: ‘and therefore marvel not hereos, for
the might of our Lord is now as great as it ever was)

And when S. Brandon had dwelled there from
Christmas even till the twelsth day was passed, then
he took his leave of the abbot and convent and
returned with his monks to his ship, and sailed
from thence with his monks toward the abbey of
S. Illaries3 but they had great tempests in the sea
