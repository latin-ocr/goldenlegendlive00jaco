30¹ S. T homas the Apostle

and made to see Syntice, the friend of Migdone‚
which was wife of CarisiuS, cousin of the king of
Inde. And Migdonia said to Syntice: ‘Weenest
thou that I may see him ?’ Then Migdone changed
her habit by the counsel of Syntice‚ and put herself
among the poor women, and came whereas the
apostle preached. And he began to preach of the
maleurte' and unhappiness of this life, and said that
this life is unhappy, wretched and subject to aventureS‚
and is so slippery and fleeting that when one
weeneth to hold it it fleeth away. And after, he
, began to show to thern by four reasons that they
should gladly hear the word of God, and likeneth it
to four manner of things: first, unto a colour, which
lighteth the eye of our understanding3 secondly, to
a syrup or a purgation‚ for the word of God purgeth
our affection from all fleshly love; thirdly, unto an
semplaister, because it healeth the wounds of our sins3
and fourthly‚ unto meat, because the word of God
nourisheth us, and delighteth in heavenly love. And
in like manner like as all these things avail not to
the sick man but if he take and receive them, in like
wise the word of God profiteth nothing to a languish-
ing sick man if he hear it not devoutly. And as the
apostle thus preached Migdonia believed in God, and
refused the company of her husband. Then Carisius
did so much that he made the apostle to be set in
prison. And Migdonia went to him ancl asked him
forgiveneSS‚ because he was set in prison for her sake.
And he comforted her sweetly, and said he would
suffer it debonairly. And then Carisius prayed the
king that he would send the queen his wife's sister Ι
