viii Preface

“ Legenda '' of Jacobus de Voragine, appearing about
the middle of the century, was hailed as “aurea‚’'
as “golden” amid the baser metal of all other such
repertorieS.

Os its history more will be said in the subsequent
biographical introduction. Its original Latin text
(we may here add) is to be found in multitudinous
manuscript copies and early printed editions in all
the great libraries of the United Kingdom and the
Continent; a convenient modern text is that of
Graesse, printed at Breslau in 1890.
