S. THOMAS AQUINAS

Sicily.'' Aquino, the birthplace 01 S. Thomas, is
near N aples. The region has sometimes been known
as the Kingdom 01 Sicily. When still called
“ Aquinum” the town was the birthplace 01 1110
satiric poet Juvenal. S. Thomas was 01 1110 Counts
01 Aquino, connected by blood with the imperial
family. To become a Dominican he gave up the
most splendid prospects. Afterwards he persisted
in refusing the ecclesiastical dignities which his rare
qualities caused 10 be pressed on him.

Thomas was born probably in 1227, and died
111 1274.

. “ Friars Preachers ’': founded by S. ,Dominic de

Guzrnan in 1215. He was a man 01 amiable though

ardently zealous character. We see 110111 our text '

what a hold his memory and special ideals took on
characters like Thomas Aquinas.

“ Child ’': he was a youth 01 17 01 18. “ Child ” in

Middle English was often used 101· a young man or
knight ; 50 111 Byron's “ Childe Harold.’'

‘ Truants ’' (French truands): itinerants‚ poor

wanderers; from a Celtic word, represented by
Irish truagh, “ wretched.'’

4. Though S. Thomas was thus spiritual, he is said never-

theless to have been a man 01 extremely bulky
figure. Partly 101· 11115 reason, but rather because 01
1115 slow and silent ways at the beginning 01 1115
studies, he was called “ the dumb ox '' by his 1011οΨ-
studentS.

Thomas Aquinas was the chief 01 111050 teachers-
