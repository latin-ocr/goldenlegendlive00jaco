S. Clare 247

knew well that they should nothing exploit of their
intent, but they turned to Agnes and said to her:
‘What makest thou here? Come out with us home
to thy house? And she answered, that she would
never depart from the company of S. Clare. And
a tyrant, a knight‚ took and drew her by the hair,
and the other took her by the armS, and carried
her forth afar. And she, which seemed that she
was among the hands of a lion, and taken from the
hands of God, began to cry and said: ‘Fair dear
sister! help me, and suffer not that Ι be taken
from the only company of Jesu Christ.' But the
felons drew this virgin against her will over the
mountain, and rent her clothes and drew and
rased out her hair. And the holy sweet virgin
S. Clare kneeled down, and put herself to prayer,
and prayed our Lord to give her sister a strong
heart and a stable‚ and that she might by the
puissance of God overcome and surmount the
puissance of the people. And anon the Holy
Ghost made her so pesant and heavy, that it
seemed that her body were fixed to the ground,
in such wise that for all the force and power that
they could do they might not bear her over a little
brook. And the men that were in the fields and
river came for to help them, but they might never
remove her from the earth. And then one of
them said in mooking: ‘It is no wonder though
she be heavy, for she hath eaten much lead.’ Then
the lord Mouvalt‚ her uncle, lift up his arm for to
beat her cruelly‚ but an ache and pain took him
suddenly, and tormented him a long time right
