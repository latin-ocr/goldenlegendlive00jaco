1 8 C axion's Introduction

to me a worshipful gentleman, a servant of his, named
John Stanney, which solicited me, in my lord's name,
that I should in no wise leave it but accomplish it,
promising that my said lord should during my life
give and grant to me a yearly fee, that is to wit, a
buck in summer and a doe in winter, with which see
I hold me well content. Then at contemplation and
reverence of my said lord I have endeavoured me to
make an end and finish this said translation, and also
have imprinted it in the most best vvise that I could
or might, and present this said book to his good and

, noble lordship, as chief causer of the achieving of it,

praying him to take it in gree of me William Caxton,
his poor servant, and that it like him to remember
my fee. And I shall pray unto Almighty God for
his long life and welfare, and after this short and
transitory life to come into everlasting joy in heaven 3
the which He send to him and me and to all them
that shall read and hear this said book, for the love

and saith of Whom all these holy saints have suffered
death and passion. Amen.
