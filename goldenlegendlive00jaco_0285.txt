THE SEVEN SLEEPERS

Παῖδες λιπόντες πρὸς μικρὸν μακροὺς ὕπνους
’Ὕπνωσαν ἆυθις τὸν μετ’ εἰρήνης ὕπνον.

These youths, a little while their wondrous sleep forsaking‚
Sink soon again to know the sleep that knows no waking.

Such were the lines written 01 1116 “ Seven Sleepers '’ by
a Greek 01 (perhaps) the seventh century. At that
date the knowledge and cult 01 111656 6001655015 were
very widely spread 110111 East to West. Their earliest
Acta date 11010 about A.D. 5oo—their supposed
awakening having occurred in 434—and before his
death in 450 Theodosius the Younger had built at
Ephesus atemple over their supposed relies. In the sixth
century S. Gregory 01 Tours translated their Acts into
Latin. Ο1 111611 celebrity' 10 1116 eleventh century we see
evidence 10 our Life 01 S. Edward. Yet,' 111 spite 01 1116
early testimony to their story and the early accept-
ance 01 their cult, critical historical opinion, even 01 1116
most orthodox school, has remained hostile. Cardinal
Baronius, 101· example, in the sixteenth century and
Dom Adrian Fortescue in the twentieth (see the
Catholic Encyolopoedia) have rejected the whole story
as a table. Its interest as a parable 01 1116 resurrec-
tion 01 1116 body and its value as an illustration 01
1100111165 00 that doctrine—points wherein lay its chief
appeal to the pious souls who accepted it as histori-
cally true—do not disappear with the acceptance 01
1116 more sceptical view, and they appear clearly in
our present version.

72. 2. The Emperor Decius reigned from A.D. 249 to 251;

75.

Theodosius the Great from 379 to 395 ; Theodosius
the Younger 11001 408 10 450. The dates in Caxton’s
version are loose and incorrect, as the translator
expressly recognizes.

. “ shillings‚’' used as equivalents 101 solidi—gold coins

which at the period 01 11115 tale were worth about
eight shillings.

S. MACARIUS

81. 1. Macarius lived> in Upper Egypt in the fourth century.

His history has been confused with that 01 other
personages 01 1116 same name.

83. 1. In 1115 repentance 101 killing the fiy that bit him, the

ancient ascetic 01 1116 Desert was (it is safe to assert)
chiefly moved by the thought 01 1115 having refused
to bear a suffering sent him by divine providence.
