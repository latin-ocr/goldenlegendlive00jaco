S. CLARE

This life of Caxton's is not one of those contained

in the original Legenda Aurea. Its somewhat too
sugary style is not that of Jacobus de Voragine. The
chief source of Clare’s biography, for Caxton‘s time
and sor ours, was a contemporary Vz'ta; there were
also the various records of S. Francis of Assisi and

lives oi rnen and women who aimed at keeping the
body entirely subservierit to the spirit, how very
small a quantity of food will suffice to keep the human
machine in good working order. Authorities on the
spiritual life seem commonly to admit that in modern
times a lite of holiness does not demand or (in some
cases) even admit of such extreme austerities as in
past ages ,· ‘this contention was put sorward eloquently
by Francis Thompson in his essay entitled “ Health
and Holiness.'’ But it is probable that moderns in
