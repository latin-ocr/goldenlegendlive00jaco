S. GREGORV THE GREAT

GREGORY is to say in our language as ‘awaked,' for

mother Silvia. And when he had so much learned

secular habit, in doing the office of the pretoria of
the provost of Rome, for to give to each man duly
reason after the right of his cause. But he found
in this office so great secular business that it began
to displease him, because by this great business he
withdrew him over far from God. In this meanwhile
his father and mother died, in such wise that he was
so rich of patrimony and puissant‚ that at the begin-

ning he founded and endowed with rents six abbeys Ἴ
