might attain him, for the arrows hung in the air
about, nigh him, without touching. Then the king
weened that he had been through-shotten with the
arrows of the knights, and addressed him for to go
to him. And one of the arrows returned suddenly
from the air and smote him in the eye, and blinded
him. To whom Christopher said: ‘Tyrant, I shall
die to-morn; make a little clay, with my blood
tempered, and anoint therewith thine eye, and thou
shalt receive health.’ Then by the commandment of
the king he was led for to be beheaded, and then
there made he his orison‚ and his head was smitten

took a little of his blood and laid it on his eye, and
said: ‘In the name of God and of S. Christopher';
and was anon healed. Then the king believed in
God, and gave commandment that if any person

blamed God or S. Christopher, he should anon be
slain with the sword.
