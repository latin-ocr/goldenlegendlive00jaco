vitaille.'' Observe how in pronunciation we still
adhere to this form rather than to the Latin victualia
to which our modern spelling pedantically 00111011113.
Victualia is from vivere—things to live on.

oil.'' The finding 01 an oily liquid 01 inoffensive or
agreeable odour in the tombs 01 persons iamed 101·
sanctity is very frequently mentioned by their
biographers. The subject is discussed and illus·
trated in the Catholic Encyelopoedia (S.V. “ Oil ’').

had do make ready '’ : had caused to be made ready.
Caxton is peculiarly iond 01 this idiom. It can
hardly be admired; yet modern English has found
no satisfactory substitute 101 it. “ He got the
dinner prepared '³ or “ he had the dinner prepared ”

The events recorded 01 S. Nicholas are so few or
so uncertain, and his local connections were so
broken up among Greece, Asia Minor and Italy, that
it is surprising how strong his cultus became, and
how vigorously it survived. He is (either alone or
with other saints) patron 01 Russia‚ Greece, NapleS‚
Sicily, Lorraine and many cities and towns, eg. Galway
in Ireland. His name, everywhere familiar, has
become peculiarly so in the form “ Santa Claus ''
under which he is, 101· the children 01 Germany,
Switzerland, the Netherlands, and nowadays 01
England‚ the distributor 01 Christmas gifts. His
selection for this office is doubtless owing to the
records 01 1113 infantine sanctity and to his having
worked :famous miracles in favour 01 little children.
