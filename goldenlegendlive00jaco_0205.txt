S. T homas of Canterbury 191

Henry ΙΙ. that was the emperice's son was made
king of England‚ and he ordained this Thomas his
chancellor, and had great rule, and the land stood
in prosperity. And S. Thomas stood so greatly in
the king's favour that the king was content with
all that he did3 and when the king went into
Normandy he betook the governance of his son
and the realm into the rule of S. ThomaS, which
he wisely governed till his return again. And
anon ‚after died Theobald, the archbishop of Canter-
bury, and then the king gave his nomination to
S. ThomaS, and by the chapter was elected in the
year of his age forty-four‚ and was full loth to take
that great charge upon him. And so at last, his
bulls had, he was sacred and stalled and became a
holy man, suddenly changed into a new man, doing
great penance, as in wearing hair with knots‚ and a
breech of the same down to the knees, And on a
Trinity Sunday received he his dignsty, and there
was at that time the king with many a great lord
and sixteen bishopS. And from thence was sent
the abbot of Evesham to the pope with other clerks
for the pall which he gave and brought to him, and
he full meekly received it. And under his habit he
ware the habit of a monk‚ and so was he under within
forth a monk‚ and outward a clerk, and did great

abstinence making his body lean and his soul fate ‘

rAnd he used to be ‘well served at his table, and took
but little refection thereof‚ and lived holily in giving
good ensample.

After this, many times the king went over into
Normandy, and in his absence always S. Thomas
