20. 15. ‘¹ Sabea '’ : a northern part of Arabia, of old farned for
its spices—“ Sabaean odours.''

21. 22. “ for his soul ” : to save his life.

22. 1. “ bless him no more.” This expresses the sense oi the
original Latin, but is the very opposite of a literal
translation. “ Benedic Deo ’ means “ bless God.’'
But it is here used for “ say good—bye to God‚” and
so “ renounce him utterly.'' In the efforts of various
translators we can see evidence of the confusion
caused by so puzzling an expression.

Caxton’s scriptural quotations are all closely
translated from the “ Vulgate ’'———“ Scripturarum
editio communis et vulgata '’—the Latin version
which since the fifth century became the official and
authorised text of Western Christendom.

20. S Gregory, first Pope of that name, called “ the Great‚’'
who sent Augustine into England to preach Christi-
anity in 597. See his life in this volume.

22. “ 1 pass over.’' It is a pity that Caxton did not supply
a brief account of the great debate carried on by Job
and his friends as to the justice and providence ot
God. Their views are not always easy to understand,
but the profundity and sublimity of the religious
poem thus composed are unrivalled.

“ A religious poem,’' or “ moral apologue,¹' is a
just description of the Book of Job: its narrative

portions give a dramatic and poetic form to events
taken from actual lite.

29-32. Observe correct use oi “ye‘' and “you‚’' as nom.
and obj. respectively.

Job was a Gentile, not a Jew, This gives a peculiar
interest to his story and to the fact of its inclusion
among the Hebrew sacred books. It shows that the
exclusiveness of the Jews--by which they were
sheltered from the corrupting influence of the sur-
rounding idolatry——did not prevent their acknowledg-
ing that the protecting hand and saving providence
of God were extended over all men alike.

The patience of Job under severe tribulation is
referred to by Tobias and by S. James. It has
become proverbial. Yet Job gave sufficient evidence
oi very strong feeling under his trials. It is consol-
ing for the sorely-tried to learn on the authority of
Scripture that the patience of a saint is not the same
thing as the patience of a stone.
