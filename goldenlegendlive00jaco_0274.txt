fail her glorious conductor is not far from her.’ Then
she called one of her daughters and said to her:

‘ Fair daughter, seest thou the king of glory whom ’

Ι see?’ But the daughter saw him not, 101 1116 will
of God was that one should see that another saw not;
for there was a happy widow and comfortable which
saw him with the eyes of her head among the tears
that she wept, and yet nevertheless she was wounded
to the heart with a dart full of sweetness and of
sorrow. Then she turned her sight toward the door
of the house and saw a great company of virgins ³
enter into the house all clad with white 61011165, and
’ 63611 01 1116111 bare a ⁶crown of gold on her head.
And among all other, there was one much more clear
and fairer than the others which bare a crown of gold
windowed‚ out whereof issued a right great 6163111655,
11131 311 1116 1101156 was 50 clearly light, that it seemed
the night to be clear day. And this lady that was so
clear approached to the bed whereas the spouse 01
1161 5011 lay, and 5116 inclined upon her and em-
braced her much sweetly. Then the virgins brought
a mantle 01 right great beauty, and the virgins en-
forced them to serve and to cover the body of S. Clare
and well to make ready the house. And on the morn
was the feast of S. Laurence‚ and then died and de-
parted out of this mortal life the holy lady and friend
of our Lord, and anon the soul 01 1161 was crowned
in everlasting joy. Ah! sweet virgin, pray thou to
Jesu Christ for 115, 101 111011 wert the first flower of
the holy poor ladies which hast drawn to penance
without number, that thou mayst conduct us to the
life permanable. Amen.
