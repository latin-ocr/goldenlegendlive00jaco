that have survived to our day from the wreck of
ancient Celtic literature. They make live again
for us peculiar racial traits of belief and imagination.
They tell the true tale of a remarkable racial impulse.
In what may be called the heroic age of Irish Christi-
anity a strange love of wandering‚ combined with
severe asceticism, desire for solitude‚ eager imagina-
tion and fearless daring‚ sent forth Irish monks and
their disciples in frail skin-covered boats to traverse
stormy oceans and to find a wild home in lonely
islets. We read of such an expedition preceding
even the preaching of S. Patricl<,—when S. Ailbe
devised an expedition to visit the “ Ultima Thule ’¹
which we now call Iceland. S. Coi-mac, called “ the
Navigator,'’ sailed far into the northern seas, nor
desisted till at last the sight of huge whales {rightened
his crew homewards again. But more wonderful
are the detailed voyages of Maeldune, of the O'Corras,
of Brendan; for in these the boundary separating
the real from the ideal, the visible material world
from the unearthly and spiritual, seems to have
vanished. We sometimes do not know whether the
fearless voyagers are landing upon some new island
of the Atlantis or entering some new region of
purgatory; whether they move in the realms of

geographical exploration, or of mystical vision, or of A

simple fairy tale.

It is not surprising to find that the Bollandists
decline altogether to admit into the serious tomes of
their Acta Sanctorum the ‘¹ Acta Brandani‚’' declaring
them to be romanoe, not history.
