176 S. Edward

ing God of the great benefits that he showed in this
land during the life of the holy saint and king,
S. Edward. Wherefore laud, glory and honour be
given to Almighty God, world without end. Amen.

The eighth day after his burying there came a
cripple to his tomb to be holpen of his great disease,
which many times afore had received alms of the
king's hand, and he had been washen of the king’s
hand on Cene - Thursday. Notwithstanding, the
miracle of his curing was prolonged by the provision
of God, and not showed in his lifetime3 because that,
many miracles God showed for him in like wise he
would show after his death. This cripple was called
Ralph, and was a Norman born, and the sinews of
his arms were shrunken together, and his feet were
drawn up to his buttocks that he might not g0‚
neither on his feet ne on his kneeS, but sat on a
hollow vessel in manner of a basin, drawing his
body after him with his hands. And when he
came to the tomb‚ he besought Almighty God and
S. Edward devoutly that he might be cured and
healed of his disease‚ which his in lifetime had
most lived by his almS. And when he had con-
tinued awhile in his prayers other people that had
compassion of him prayed for him a150, and at the
last he lifted himself up, and felt his sinews loosed‚
and then he arose up and stood on his feet, and
felt himself made perfectly whole for to do what
he should.

We have read of the virtues that S. Edward had
in healing blind men in his living, which our Lord
hath not withdrawn from him after his death. It
