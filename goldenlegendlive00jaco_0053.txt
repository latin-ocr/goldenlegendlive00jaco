and we have laid her in her sepulchre. Now send
thither messengers for to fetch our ring of gold and
our gloves, which whiles I made me ready to bury
her, Ι delivered them to the sexton‚ and I have for-
gotten them there because ye awoke me so soon.'
Then were messengers sent forth, and as the bishop
said, they found his ring and one glove which they
brought again, and that other the sexton retained for
a witness and memory. And the blessed Frontonius
added theretO, saying that after her sepulture a
brother of the same place, a learned man in the law,
demanded of our Lord what was his name? To
whom he answered not, but showed a book open in
his hand in which was written this versicle: ‘In
everlasting memory shall be my rightful hostess, and
she shall dread none evil in the last day'; and when
he should turn the leaves of the book, in every leaf
he found the same written. Where afterward many
miracles were showed and done at her tomb. Then
Clovis‚ king of France, was after this made a christian
man, and baptized of S. Remigius, and suffering
great pain in his reinS, carne to her tomb and there
received very health. For which cause he enriched
that place; and the space of three miles way about
on both sides of the river of Rhone‚ as well towns as
castleS, he gave to the same place, and that place he
made free. Marcilla, her servant, wrote her life,-
which afterward *went into Sclavonia and there
preached the gospel of Christ, and after ten years
from the death of Martha she rested in our Lord.
