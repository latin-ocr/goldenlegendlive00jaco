strong axeS, and by the feebleness of his nature was
reputed and holden as for dead of all them which
about him were, for his eyes were shut in manner

Ives made for the salue of the said archbishop by
his parents and friendS‚ with weepingS, VOWS,
devotionS, was the foresaid archbishop through the

Α merits of the saint restored unto life, sight and good

health3 by the grace and virtue of him of whom it is
written that he enlumineth the eyen, giveth life,
health and messing, light, sapience, the which God‚
creator, enluminator, and saviour be thanked‚
praised and worshipped by all the siecle and
siecles! Amen.
