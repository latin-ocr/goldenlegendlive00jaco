S. THOMAS, APOSTLE

S. Thomas is well known to us from the Gospels.
In his 2oth chapter the Evangelist John tells us 01
1115 doubt concerning the reality 01 our Lord’s resur-
rection and the setting 01 111055 (10111)15 51 1551 by 1
1115 condescension 01 Christ, who permitted him to
touch and examine 1115 wounds inflicted during the
Passion. The incidents which occupy the text 01 1115
Golden Legewd have their earliest source (50 far as 15
known) in 1115 ‘lota Tho noe, a romantio composition
written (probably) in Syriae about the beginning 01
1115 third century.

24. 6. The tradition that S. Thomas carried the preaching 01
the Gospel as 151 55 Hindostan has much to support
it King‘ ‘'Gundoierus' was an historical personage.
About the year A. D. 46 5 king was reigning over that
part 01 Α515 comprised in the modern Afghanistan,
Baluchistan, the PunJ’aub and Sind, who bore the
name Gondophernes 01 Guduphara: we know this
110111 1115 001115, and 11051 an inscription 51 Takhti-
Bahi. A body 01 Christians has existed in India
from very early ages, which has always claimed
S. Thomas as their founder, and there is some
traditional evidence 01 1115 having suffered martyrdom
at Mylapore in the district 01 Madras.

23. “ The King would be angry.’' Like the king in the
Gospel (Luke xiv.), when the invited guests offered
excuses 101· not attending his great marriage feast.

26. The praising 01 guests, especially distinguished ones,
by minstrels at a feast is an old custom in many
lands. It might seem an anticipation 01 0111 modern
complimentary aiter-dinner speeches. Cp. the greet-
ing 01 Μ511111011 by the ministrels at Norham :

And there, with herald pomp and state,

They hailed Lord Marmion ε

They hailed him Lord 01 Fontenaye, . . .
01 Tamworth tower and town.
