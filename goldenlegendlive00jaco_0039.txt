S. T homas the Apostle 2 5

the apostle she knew that he was an Hebrew‚ because
he ate not, but had alway his eyen firm toward heaven.
And as the maid sang tofore him in Hebrew, she
said: ‘The God of heaven is one only God, the
which created all things and founded the seas.' And
the apostle made her to say these words again. And
the butler beheld him, and saw that Thomas ate not
ne drank not, but alway looked upward to heaven.
And he came to the apostle and smote him on the
cheek; and the apostle said to him: ‘That in time
to come it be pardoned to thee, and that now a
wound transitory be given to thee'; and said: ‘I
shall not arise from this place till the hand that hath
smitten me be eaten with dogS.' And anon after, the
butler went for to fetch water at a well, and 111616 3
11011 631116 and slew him and drank his blood, and the
hounds drew his body into picceS, in such wisc that
a black dog brought the right arm into the hall in
the middle of the dinner. And when they saw this,
all the company was abashed‚ and the maid re-
membered the wordS, and threw down her pipe or
flute, and fell down 31 1116 feet of the apostle. And
this vengeance blameth S. Austin in his book of
FaustiUS‚ and saith that this was set in of some false
prophetS‚ for this thing might be suspicions unto
many things, Whether it be true or no it appertaineth
not to me, but I wot well that they should be like as
our Lord 1636116111, which saith: ‘ If any man smiteth
thee on that one cheek, show and offer to him that
other,' and certainly the apostle held within his
courage the will of God and of dilection‚ and without
forth he [the butler] required example of correction.
