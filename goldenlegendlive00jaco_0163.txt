S. Edward 149

of God, I purpose to visit and to honour in the same
place where they now rest, if thou, Lord, send to me
life, health, opportunity and space.'

And when King Canute had reigned in England
twenty yearS‚ having two sons by the said Emma,
that is to wit, Harold and Hardicanute, he died, and
when his first son had reigned four years, he exiled
his own mother, and died soon after. And after him
reigned his brother a little time, and died aISO, as our
Lord had ordained, and then was England delivered
from the grievous tribute and thraldom of the Danes
And then the lords and the commons of England
remembered the oath that they made 1n the parlia-

ment‚ which sware that Edward, which was then in
his mother's womb‚ should be their king, and anon

sent into Normandy for this holy child Edward.
And the lords and the commons received him with
great gladneSS, and then the archbishop of Canter-
bury and the archbishop of York, with other bishops,
did consecrate him, anointed and crowned him king
of England.

O good Lord! what joy and gladness was then in
England. For when the old felicity of this land was
almost despaired, then it was kindled again by the
coming of this blessed king S. Edward. Then had
the commons rest and peace, and the lords and
gentlemen rest and honour, and then holy church
received all her liberties again. Then was the sun
lifted up and the moon set in his order, that is to
say, priests shined in wisdom and in holiness. The
monasteries flourished in devotion by holy religion.
The clerks gave light and prospered in their offices
